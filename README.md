# Data-Driven GRF-Muscle Force Model

## Description

This project aims to deveop a data-driven model  of the relationship between ground reaction forces and muscle forces using deep learning techniques. This model will be trained on a data from ten healthy individuals walking on an instrumented treadmill that has been collected, processed, and open-sourced by [Uhlrich et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13386-9).
